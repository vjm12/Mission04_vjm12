    <p>
        I hope to learn more about ASP.Net and C#.
        Right now I hardly understand anything about C# because it is a strongly typed language and there are no other resources except the videos, which I do not learn well from
        I also hope to know what the purpose of ASP.Net is, as opposed to HTML, Javascript, and Python.
        Also, what is the meaning of "Enterprise Application Development" and how does it relate to the actual industry?
        I hope to gain more knowledge and confidence in these areas.
